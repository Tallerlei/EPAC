# Purpose of the application
The application is supposed to load a xml file from a server when the user pushes a button.
The xml file contains structural information that shall be displayed on screen.

# Third-party-modules
I included Primeng + font-awesome for multiple reasons e.g. configurable drag'n'drop, messages and context menu. It is very handy and can be configured and extended to your needs.
Furthermore it comes with some styling I use to implement a good look and feel.
